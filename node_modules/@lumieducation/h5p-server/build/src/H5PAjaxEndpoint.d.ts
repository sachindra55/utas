/**
 * Each method in this class corresponds to a route that is called by the H5P
 * client. Normally, the implementation must call them and send back the
 * return values as a JSON body in the HTTP response.
 *
 * If something goes wrong, the methods throw H5pErrors, which include HTTP
 * status codes. Send back these status codes in your HTTP response.
 *
 * Remarks:
 * - Most of the route names can be configured in the IH5PConfig object and thus
 *   might have different names in your case!
 * - The GET /content/<contentId>/<file> and GET /temp-files/<file> routes
 *   should support partials for the Interactive Video editor to work. This
 *   means that the response with HTTP 200 must send back the header
 *   'Accept-Ranges: bytes' and must send back status code 206 for partials.
 *   Check out the documentation of the methods `getContentFile` and
 *   `getTemporaryFile` for more details.

     * of the query like this: GET /ajax?action=xyz Possible values:
     *   - content-type-cache: Requests information about available content
     *     types from the server. The user parameter must be set, as the
     *     accessible content types and possible actions (update, etc.) can vary
     *     from user to user
     *   - content-hub-metadata-cache: Requests information about the metadata
     *     currently in use by the H5P Content Hub.
     *   - libraries: Requests detailed data about a single library. The
     *     parameters machineName, majorVersion, minorVersion and language must
     *     be set in this case. Queries look like this: GET
     *     /ajax?action=libraries?machineName=<machine_name>&majorVersion=<major_version>&minorVersion=<minor_version>
     * @param machineName (need if action == 'libraries') The machine name of

     * is part of the query, e.g. +machineName=H5P.Example
     * @param majorVersion (need if action == 'libraries') The major version of
     * the library about which information is requested, e.g. '1'.
     * @param minorVersion (need if action == 'libraries') The minor version of
     * the library about which information is requested, e.g. '0'.
     * @param language (can be set if action == 'libraries') The language in
     * which the editor is currently displayed, e.g. 'en'. Will default to
     * English if unset.
     * @param user (needed if action == 'content-type-cache') The user who is
     * displaying the H5P Content Type Hub. It is the job of the implementation
     * to inject this object.
